 An `IGListAdapterUpdater` is a concrete type that conforms to `IGListUpdatingDelegate`.
 It is an out-of-box updater for `IGListAdapter` objects to use.

 @note This updater performs re-entrant, coalesced updating for a list. It also uses a least-minimal diff
 for calculating UI updates when `IGListAdapter` calls
 `-performUpdateWithCollectionView:fromObjects:toObjects:completion:`.
